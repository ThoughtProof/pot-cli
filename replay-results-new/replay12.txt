📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Synthesized Answer: 8 Planets in Our Solar System

There are **8 planets** in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

## The Definition

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) established in 2006 that a planet must:
1. Orbit the Sun
2. Have sufficient mass for self-gravity to achieve a roughly spherical shape
3. Have **cleared the neighborhood** around its orbit

Pluto fails criterion #3 — it shares its orbital zone with thousands of other Kuiper Belt objects — and was reclassified as a **dwarf planet** on August 24, 2006, after 76 years as the 9th planet.

## Where Models Disagreed

All four models agreed on the core answer (8 planets), which is expected for settled institutional science. The meaningful disagreements were in **supporting claims and depth**:

| Issue | Disagreement | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Hallucinated citations** | Proposal 1 fabricated a 2015 survey in *Research Notes of the AAS* (a journal not launched until 2017), claimed Caltech models give Planet Nine <1% probability (Caltech's Batygin & Brown actually *advocate* for Planet Nine), and cited unverifiable JWST/Google statistics. No other model corroborated these. | This is the most valuable signal from cross-verification — impressive-looking specifics that collapse under scrutiny. |
| **Depth of edge cases** | Proposals 2 & 4 were brief; Proposal 3 engaged substantively with Alan Stern's objections, the geophysical definition debate, and the Planet Nine hypothesis. | The question is simple, but the epistemic landscape is richer than "just 8." |
| **Framing as "settled"** | All models framed this as settled science. The critique correctly notes it's more precisely **settled institutional nomenclature** — the 2006 vote involved only ~424 of ~10,000 IAU members, on the last day of the assembly. | This shared framing is a mild consensus bias worth flagging. |

## Addressing the Critique's Key Flags

**On the IAU vote's legitimacy:** The 2006 vote was controversial — the original proposal would have *expanded* the count to 12, and the final resolution was a hastily revised compromise. While the result stands institutionally, a non-trivial minority of planetary scientists (notably Alan Stern, New Horizons PI) actively contest the "cleared its neighborhood" criterion, arguing that Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune also haven't fully cleared their orbits.

**On Planet Nine:** Hypothesized based on orbital clustering of distant trans-Neptunian objects, primarily by Caltech's Batygin and Brown. No direct observation exists. If discovered and meeting IAU criteria, the count would become 9. Current status: unconfirmed.

**On alternative definitions:** The geophysical planet definition (Stern & Runyon, 2017) would classify any gravitationally rounded body as a planet, potentially adding ~100+ objects including Pluto, Eris, Ceres, and large moons (as "satellite planets"). This has not gained institutional adoption.

## Key Numbers
- **8** IAU-recognized planets
- **5** recognized dwarf planets (Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Ceres)
- **290+** known moons in the solar system
- **5,500+** confirmed exoplanets (not in our solar system)

## Bottom Line

**8 planets** is the correct answer per the current governing scientific body (IAU) and overwhelming institutional consensus. This is stable and unlikely to change unless Planet Nine is discovered, or the IAU revises its definition.

## Platform Signal

This query perfectly illustrates multi-agent verification value: the most detailed-*looking* response (Proposal 1) contained multiple hallucinated citations, an internal contradiction (claimed "over 99%" acceptance then cited 94%), and a backwards probability claim. Single-agent systems cannot catch this. Cross-referencing revealed these claims were uncorroborated — exactly the signal an epistemic audit layer exists to surface.

**Confidence: 97%** (capped at 85% per protocol → **Confidence: 85%**)

This is a factual question with near-universal scientific and institutional agreement. The only sources of uncertainty are future discoveries (Planet Nine) or definitional revision, neither of which affects the current answer.
