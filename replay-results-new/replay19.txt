📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Which U.S. State Produces the Most Peaches?

## Answer: **California** — by a wide margin.

California produces roughly **50–60% of all U.S. peach output**, consistently leading the nation for decades. This is not close.

## Best-Estimate Production Figures

| State | Approximate Annual Production | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **California** | ~475,000–580,000 short tons | Dominated by clingstone (processing/canning) varieties in the San Joaquin Valley |
| **South Carolina** | ~90,000–100,000 short tons | #2 nationally; primarily fresh-market freestone peaches |
| **Georgia** | ~36,000–50,000 short tons | "The Peach State" by culture, **not** by production volume |
| **New Jersey** | ~25,000 short tons | Minor but notable producer |

**Important caveat:** These figures are synthesized from ranges across three proposals that broadly agreed (475K–580K for California). No proposal provided a verified, clickable USDA NASS citation. Treat these as plausible approximations, not confirmed statistics.

## Why California Dominates

1. **Central Valley climate**: Hot, dry summers and cool nights — ideal for peach cultivation
2. **Industrial scale**: Massive orchards oriented toward canning and processing
3. **Irrigation infrastructure**: Sierra Nevada water systems support consistent yields
4. **Decades of structural advantage**: California has led since the 1920s

## The Georgia Myth

Georgia's "Peach State" nickname is **historical and cultural**, not a reflection of current production. Georgia typically ranks 3rd or 4th nationally. South Carolina produces roughly double Georgia's output.

## Where Models Disagreed

### 1. Production Numbers (Major Disagreement)
Proposal 1 (Grok) claimed California produced **1,321,000 tons** — nearly 3x the figures cited by every other model (475K–580K). The critic identified this as almost certainly hallucinated, likely generated by multiplying inflated acreage (65K) by inflated yield (20 tons/acre). **I exclude this figure entirely.**

### 2. The Answer Itself
Three models said **California**. Proposal 4 (DeepSeek) said **Georgia**, arguing the question "really means" fresh-market peaches. This is question-substitution: the proposal explicitly acknowledged California's total volume dominance, then redefined the question to reach a different answer. The question asks which state *produces the most peaches* — that means total volume. **California wins on every reasonable metric**, and even in fresh-market peaches, California remains a major producer.

### 3. Minor Factual Claims (Unresolved)
- Whether South Carolina ever exceeds California in dollar value (Proposal 3's claim — **dubious** given California's 5–6x volume advantage)
- Whether a specific 20–30% crop loss occurred in 2016 (Proposal 2 — **unverified**)
- Whether Georgia's production declined 40% since 2010 (Proposal 1 — **unverified**)
- Whether a catastrophic South Carolina freeze occurred in 2024 (Proposal 3 — **unverified**)

## What Could Go Wrong With This Answer

1. **Data lag**: USDA NASS data runs 1–2 years behind. A catastrophic California event could temporarily alter rankings (though structural dominance would persist).
2. **Metric ambiguity**: If someone specifically asks about fresh-market freestone peaches only, the Southeast states close the gap — but California still produces substantial fresh-market volume.
3. **Climate trends**: Drought and water restrictions in California could erode dominance over the next decade, but this is a long-term structural shift, not a current reality.

## Meta-Observation

The critic correctly noted that even on this "simple" factual question, one model hallucinated statistics inflated by ~3x, and another arrived at the wrong answer through deliberate reframing. **The disagreements between models were the most valuable signal** — they revealed which claims to trust and which to discard.

---

**Confidence: 82%**

High confidence that California is #1 by total volume in any normal production year. Docked from 85% because no proposal provided verified USDA source links, and exact tonnage figures vary across models without authoritative confirmation.
