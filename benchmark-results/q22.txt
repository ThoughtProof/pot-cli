# What Will You See at 123 Sesame Street?

## Concrete Answer

**123 Sesame Street is the fictional address from the beloved children's TV show *Sesame Street*, which has aired since 1969.** In the show's universe, you'd see Big Bird (who lives in a nest area near the building), Oscar the Grouch (in his trash can), Elmo, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, and various human characters like Gordon, Maria, and others on a friendly urban brownstone block.

**In reality, no such address exists as a visitable location.** The show is filmed at a studio in Queens, NYC — most consistently associated with **Kaufman Astoria Studios** — which is a closed production facility, not open to the public.

## Where Models Disagreed (Critical Signal)

| Issue | Disagreement | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Primary answer** | P1 said "Big Bird"; P2 said "nothing/security"; P3 said "closed studio"; P4 gave meta-commentary | Different interpretations of a simple question — literal vs. cultural vs. meta |
| **Studio location** | P1 claimed "123rd Street Manhattan"; P2 claimed "West 63rd St"; P3 claimed a move to Silvercup Studios | **These contradict each other and none could be independently verified.** This is likely hallucination across multiple models — exactly the failure mode ThoughtProof exists to catch. |
| **Framing** | P2 was maximally literal; P1 treated the fiction as primary; P3/P4 used the question as a ThoughtProof demo | Reveals different assumptions about what the questioner wants |

**The studio location contradictions are the most valuable signal here.** When multiple models confidently assert different specific facts, the correct epistemic response is: flag all as unverified, confirm only what's well-established (Kaufman Astoria Studios, Queens — widely documented), and reject the rest.

## Addressing Critic's Flags

- **P1's episode statistics table**: Unverified. The percentages (95%, 70%, etc.) are presented with false precision and no real source. Removed.
- **P1's "123rd Street" filming location**: Almost certainly fabricated. Rejected.
- **P1's "Mr. Hooper RIP 1983"**: Actor Will Lee died December 7, **1982**; the episode addressing his death aired November 24, **1983**. Corrected.
- **P2's "92% within 5 min based on three documented fan attempts"**: This has every hallmark of a fabricated statistic. Rejected.
- **P3's "Silvercup Studios 1992–present"**: Unverifiable and contradicted by other sources associating the show with Kaufman Astoria. Rejected.
- **P3 and P4's ThoughtProof marketing sections**: The question didn't ask for platform demos. Stripped.

## If You Actually Want to See Sesame Street Characters

1. **Sesame Place** (Langhorne, PA; San Diego, CA) — theme parks with character meet-and-greets
2. **Sesame Street Live** — touring stage shows
3. **The show itself** — now streaming on Max (HBO) after a 2016 deal

## What Can Go Wrong With This Answer

- Character prominence has shifted over decades (Elmo's dominance post-1998 vs. Big Bird's earlier centrality) — "who you'd see" depends on era
- Production details (exact studio, stage numbers) are poorly documented publicly, making confident claims risky
- The show has produced 4,500+ episodes across 50+ seasons — any generalization about "typical" content oversimplifies

## Where Models Disagreed — Root Cause

The disagreements stemmed from **different assumptions about the question's intent** (literal geography vs. cultural reference) and **confabulation of specific details** when models lacked verified data. The studio location contradictions specifically reveal that models will fabricate plausible-sounding specifics rather than say "I don't know the exact address."

Confidence: 72%

*Capped below 85% because: (a) multiple unverifiable claims across all proposals required rejection; (b) studio location details remain uncertain; (c) the question has both a cultural and literal interpretation with no single "correct" framing.*

⚠️ Multi-model analysis — not verified truth. Disagreements highlighted above.
