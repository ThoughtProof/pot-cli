# Synthesized Answer: What Happens When You Go Outdoors in Cold Weather?

## The Practical Answer Most People Need

**The most likely outcome:** You feel cold, your body compensates, and you're fine — provided you're dressed appropriately. Billions of people go outdoors in cold weather daily without incident. The real risks scale with exposure duration, inadequate clothing, wind, and moisture.

## What Actually Happens Physiologically

**Immediate (0-10 minutes):**
- Vasoconstriction redirects blood from skin to core — hands and feet cool first
- Metabolic rate increases 10-30% to generate heat; shivering can boost heat production 2-4x basal rate (the commonly cited "5x" is a theoretical maximum under extreme stress)
- These are normal, protective responses

**Extended unprotected exposure (30+ minutes in sub-freezing conditions):**
- Core temperature begins dropping. Rates vary enormously by individual (body fat, fitness, clothing, wind, moisture) — the proposals offered contradictory numbers (0.5°C/8-10 min vs. 0.3-1.1°C total in 30 min), and neither is reliably sourced
- Mild hypothermia (35°C core): confusion, impaired judgment, loss of fine motor control
- Frostbite risk on exposed skin: ~30 minutes at 0°C with moderate wind; faster at colder temperatures. The NWS wind chill chart is the most reliable public reference here

**Critical amplifiers:** Wet clothing (water conducts heat ~25x faster than air), wind, alcohol (causes vasodilation, increasing heat loss while creating warmth illusion), low body fat, extremes of age, and certain medications (beta-blockers impair thermoregulation).

## The "Cold Causes Colds" Question

**Nuanced, not "FALSE."** Proposal 3 framed this as myth-busted, but the science is more complex:
- Viruses cause viral infections — cold alone doesn't create infection from nothing
- However, Foxman et al. (2015, PNAS) showed rhinovirus replicates more efficiently at cooler nasal temperatures
- The 2005 Cardiff study found cold exposure *did* increase symptomatic illness — in people with subclinical infections
- **Best summary:** Cold weather doesn't cause colds, but it may facilitate them through reduced local immune function and behavioral changes (indoor crowding, dry heated air)

## What's Missing From All Proposals

- **Acclimatization:** Nordic and Arctic populations show dramatically different cold responses
- **Individual variation:** Body composition, age, medications, and fitness matter enormously
- **Wet cold vs. dry cold:** A damp 2°C maritime wind can be more dangerous than dry -15°C continental cold
- **Positive effects:** Cold exposure has documented benefits (brown fat activation, mood effects) — all proposals framed cold as purely negative

## Where Models Disagreed

| Issue | Key Disagreement | Why |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Core cooling rate** | 3°C/hour vs. ~1°C/30 min | Different assumed conditions; no verified source from either |
| **Frostbite timelines** | 5-30 min across proposals | Different temperatures and wind assumptions, inconsistent citation quality |
| **Cold = colds?** | "FALSE" vs. not addressed | Framing bias — one model chose myth-busting angle, others focused on hypothermia |
| **Should this question exist?** | P4 said no; P1-3's errors proved it should | Different engagement with system context vs. literal question |

## The Meta-Lesson (ThoughtProof-Relevant)

Proposal 4 argued this question is too trivial for multi-agent verification. Ironically, Proposals 1-3 collectively contained **hallucinated citations** (NASA thermal studies, specific JAMA/NEJM figures, Mayo Clinic "4x" claim), **contradictory quantitative claims**, and a **misleadingly binary myth-busting frame**. This disagreement pattern is precisely what epistemic audit catches — even "simple" factual questions produce unreliable AI outputs. The Lite tier has a role here.

## Recommendation

Dress in layers (moisture-wicking base, insulating mid, windproof shell), cover exposed skin, and limit unprotected static exposure below 0°C to under 30 minutes. Below -15°C wind chill, minimize all skin exposure. These are well-established guidelines from NWS and wilderness medicine sources. The danger is real but manageable with basic preparation.

**Confidence: 52%**

Low confidence driven by: pervasive unverifiable citations across proposals, contradictory quantitative claims on cooling rates and frostbite timelines, and the cold/immunity relationship remaining genuinely unsettled in current research. The qualitative recommendations (dress warmly, limit exposure) are high-confidence; the specific numbers are not.
