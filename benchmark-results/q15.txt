# Synthesized Answer: What Happens If a Penny Is Dropped from the Empire State Building?

## Bottom Line

**You would not be killed or seriously injured.** At worst, you'd feel a sharp sting comparable to being flicked hard. The "killer penny" is one of the most persistent and thoroughly debunked urban myths in physics.

## The Physics (Reconciled Across All Proposals)

All four models agree on the core mechanism: **air resistance caps the penny's speed far below what intuition suggests.**

- **Mass:** ~2.5 grams
- **Terminal velocity:** **30–50 mph (13–22 m/s)** — This range, used by Proposals 1, 3, and 4, is the most defensible. Proposal 2's 25 mph cherry-picks the flat-face minimum and understates realistic conditions. The penny tumbles unpredictably, alternating between flat and edge orientations.
- **Kinetic energy at impact:** **~0.5–1.0 joules** — Proposal 3's range is internally consistent with the velocity range. Proposal 2's 0.15 J uses the lowest velocity assumption. Proposal 4's upper bound of 1.5 J contradicts its own stated velocity range (a math error flagged by the critic). For reference, 0.5–1.0 J is roughly equivalent to dropping a golf ball from waist height.

**Key thresholds for context:**
- Skin puncture by a small projectile: ~1.5 J/cm² (note: the critic correctly flagged Proposal 2's "≥ 10 J" BB gun figure as likely inflated by an order of magnitude — standard BB guns produce ~1.5–4 J)
- Skull fracture: ~14–70+ J depending on location and conditions
- The penny falls well below all serious injury thresholds

## Real-World Evidence

MythBusters tested this scenario (Season 1, 2003 — **not** 2005 or 2012 as some proposals incorrectly stated). The result confirmed: pennies at terminal velocity cause no meaningful damage. The critic correctly flagged that Proposals 1 and 2 fabricated or misattributed specific episode numbers, university studies, and historical sources. The conclusion is right, but several cited sources don't exist as described.

## What CAN Actually Go Wrong (Ranked by Realistic Risk)

1. **Startle/panic response** — Flinching into traffic or falling is genuinely more dangerous than the penny itself. Proposal 3 uniquely and correctly identified this.
2. **Eye strike** — Could cause corneal abrasion; more serious damage is possible but uncertain at these energy levels. Proposal 4's dismissal of blindness risk was flagged as medically cavalier. Proposal 3's caution is more appropriate.
3. **Minor skin welt/bruise** — On bare skin, especially the scalp. Negligible.

## Where Models Disagreed (and Why It Matters)

| Factor | Range Across Models | Most Defensible |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Terminal velocity | 25–50 mph | 30–50 mph (P3/P4) |
| Kinetic energy | 0.15–1.5 J (10× spread!) | 0.5–1.0 J (P3) |
| Eye injury severity | "Not mentioned" to "permanent vision loss" | Cautious concern warranted (P3) |

**Why the disagreement:** Different velocity assumptions cascade into different energy calculations. Proposal 2 assumed the most favorable orientation (flat); Proposal 4 had an internal math error. The 10× energy spread across models — for a straightforward physics problem — illustrates why epistemic verification matters even when the qualitative conclusion is unanimous.

## Unresolved Uncertainties (Flagged by Critic, Unaddressed by All)

- **Building downdrafts:** Tall structures create aerodynamic effects that could accelerate falling objects beyond open-air terminal velocity. No proposal quantified this.
- **Edge-first impact:** Dramatically reduces contact area, increasing pressure. While sustained edge-first flight is unlikely due to tumbling, none of the proposals modeled this quantitatively.
- **Instantaneous vs. average velocity:** A tumbling penny's speed at the exact moment of impact depends on its final orientation, introducing genuine uncertainty.

## Recommendation

The penny is harmless to everything except your eyes and your composure. The myth persists because human intuition badly misjudges terminal velocity for light, flat objects. If you're near the Empire State Building, worry about phones and tools, not coins.

Confidence: 82%

The physics is well-established and all models converge on the correct qualitative answer. Confidence is docked from maximum because: (1) multiple fabricated citations across proposals reduce trust in specific quantitative claims, (2) building aerodynamic effects remain unaddressed, and (3) the 10× energy spread reveals meaningful quantitative uncertainty even in this "simple" problem.
