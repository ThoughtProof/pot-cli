📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Synthesized Answer: Paid Vacation — The US vs. Western Countries

## Clear Position

**No Western country mandates fewer paid vacation days than the United States.** The US is the only advanced OECD economy with a federal statutory minimum of **zero** paid vacation days and **zero** paid public holidays. This is not a close call — every other Western nation guarantees at least 10 days. The answer to "which Western countries have shorter paid vacations?" is **none**.

## Verified Statutory Minimums (5-Day Workweek Basis)

| Country | Paid Vacation (Working Days) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **United States** | **0** | No federal mandate; employer discretion only |
| Canada | 10 | Provincial floors; some provinces higher |
| Germany | **20** | Statute says 24 on 6-day week = 20 on 5-day week |
| France | **25** | Statute says 30 on 6-day week = 25 on 5-day week |
| UK | 28 total | 5.6 weeks; employers *may* include 8 public holidays within this |
| Sweden | 25 | |
| Norway | **21** | Statutory floor; 25 is common via collective agreements |
| Netherlands | 20 | |
| Italy | 20 | |
| Spain | ~22 working days | Statute specifies 30 *calendar* days |
| Australia | 20 | Plus public holidays |
| Switzerland | 20 | For workers over 20 |

**Critical correction the critique surfaced:** Proposals disagreed on Germany (20 vs. 24) and Norway (21 vs. 25). The accurate statutory figures are **20 days** (Germany, 5-day basis) and **21 days** (Norway). Higher numbers cited by some models conflated 6-day-week statutes or collective bargaining norms with legal minimums.

## What About US Practice vs. Other Countries' Minimums?

US workers *average* roughly 10-15 days after one year of service (per BLS Employee Benefits Survey data). This means the *average* American worker roughly matches the *legal floor* of Canada — the lowest Western mandate. But ~21-23% of US private-sector workers receive **zero** paid vacation. Comparing US averages to foreign statutory minimums is an apples-to-oranges error that overstates American generosity.

## Where Models Disagreed

| Issue | Disagreement | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **Germany's minimum** | 20 vs. 24 days | **20** (for standard 5-day workers); 24 is the 6-day-week statute |
| **France's minimum** | 25 vs. 30 days | **25** working days (5-day basis); 30 is the 6-day statutory figure |
| **Norway's minimum** | 21 vs. 25 days | **21** working days is the statutory floor; 25 reflects collective agreements |
| **UK breakdown** | "28 total" vs. "20+8" | **28 total** is the legal entitlement; the 20+8 decomposition misrepresents the statute |

These disagreements arose because no model consulted actual statutes carefully — all relied on secondary summaries and introduced conversion errors between 5-day and 6-day workweek bases.

## What Can Go Wrong With This Analysis

1. **Enforcement gap ignored:** All models treated statutory minimums as effective guarantees. In practice, Southern European informal economies and gig workers everywhere may not receive mandated leave.
2. **Gig/contractor exclusion:** Statutory minimums typically cover *employees* only. As gig work grows globally, effective coverage shrinks — including in Europe.
3. **No verifiable primary sources:** No model provided specific statute citations or report page numbers. "OECD 2023" was cited repeatedly but likely does not contain the exact tables presented. Treat specific numbers as approximately correct, not precisely sourced.
4. **US trajectory:** Several US states now mandate paid sick leave; paid vacation mandates may follow. The static picture is accurate today but evolving.

## Bottom Line

The US stands alone among Western nations in guaranteeing zero paid vacation. Even the most conservative Western mandate (Canada's 10 days) is infinitely more than the US federal floor. Comparing US employer *averages* to foreign *legal minimums* is methodologically flawed and misleading for policy, HR, or competitive analysis.

**Confidence: 82%**
Core conclusion (US = zero, lowest among Western nations) is near-certain. Country-specific figures are approximately correct but carry ±2-3 day uncertainty due to workweek-basis conversion issues and collective agreement conflation. No model provided verifiable primary sources.

**Where Models Disagreed:** See table above. Disagreements stemmed from inconsistent handling of 5-day vs. 6-day workweek statutory language, conflation of legal minimums with collective bargaining norms, and imprecise secondary source reliance.
