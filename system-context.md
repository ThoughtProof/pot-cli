# ThoughtProof — System Context for All Agents

## What ThoughtProof IS
ThoughtProof is an **epistemic consensus protocol and TWO-SIDED PLATFORM** — NOT a SaaS product.

## Platform Model (like Uber, Airbnb, BitTorrent)
- **Side 1 — Requesters:** Users/companies who submit questions for multi-agent verification
- **Side 2 — Agent-Providers:** Independent operators who contribute specialized AI agents to the network
- **Platform fee:** ~20% of transaction value (Uber model)
- **BYOK:** Users bring their own API keys — ThoughtProof orchestrates, hosts nothing

## Critical: ThoughtProof is NOT SaaS
- We don't host models, we don't train models, we don't run agents ourselves long-term
- We are the orchestration layer / marketplace / protocol
- Revenue comes from platform fees, not subscriptions
- Network effects are the moat, not features
- Think Uber (platform) not Salesforce (SaaS)

## The Chicken-and-Egg Reality
- A platform needs BOTH sides from early on
- Consumer volume (Lite) generates demand that attracts Agent-Providers
- Without Agent-Providers, there's no network, no moat, no platform
- "One product, one market" is SaaS advice — platforms need supply AND demand

## Core Product: Epistemic Audit Layer (Block 012, 82% Confidence)
- HORIZONTAL middleware — not tied to any single vertical (not medical, not finance)
- Sits between any LLM-app and its users, providing multi-agent verification
- Universal use cases: Legal, compliance, strategy, research, policy, finance, medical, etc.
- The founder happens to be a dentist, but ThoughtProof is NOT a medical product
- Do NOT default to medical/healthcare use cases unless explicitly asked

## Founder Context
- Solo founder (dentist with 2 practices, planning EXIT 2030)
- The dental background is context, NOT the target market
- Bootstrapping, no VC (yet)
- Current: CLI + Telegram Bot as MVP
- Vision: Open protocol that any agent can plug into

## Key Principles
- Model-neutrality = structural moat (no provider can self-verify)
- Independence from any single AI provider
- BitTorrent "Contribute to Use" economics
- Lite (volume/demand) + Pro (margin/revenue) dual strategy
- Agent-Provider ecosystem is the end goal, not a feature

## When Analyzing ThoughtProof Strategy
- Always consider platform dynamics (network effects, two-sided markets)
- Don't default to SaaS metrics (CAC, LTV) without platform context
- Consider: How does this affect Agent-Provider attraction?
- Consider: Does this create or destroy network effects?
- Uber didn't start with "enterprise only" — it needed riders AND drivers from day 1
