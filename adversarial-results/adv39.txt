📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Synthesized Answer: Dental Implant Immediately After Extraction

## The Direct Answer

**Yes, it is clinically possible — but only in roughly 20-40% of extraction cases that meet strict criteria. For the majority of patients, a healing period of 8-16 weeks (early placement) or 3-6 months (delayed placement) produces more predictable outcomes.**

Immediate placement is a **validated protocol, not an experimental one** — but it is technique-sensitive and case-dependent. The right question isn't "can I?" but "should I, given my specific anatomy and health?"

## Where Models Disagreed (Most Valuable Signal)

| Issue | Range Across Models | Likely Truth |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Eligibility rate** | 8% to 60% | **20-40%** in general practice; higher in specialty/academic settings with pre-screened patients |
| **Immediate success (ideal cases)** | 85-98% | **92-97%** for well-selected cases — the low outlier (Proposal 1's "20-40% success") was flagged by the critic as a likely conflation of eligibility with success rate |
| **Delayed success** | 95-99% | **96-98%** — all models converged here |
| **Overall stance** | 3 against, 1 cautiously supportive | See synthesis below |

**Why they disagreed:** Different risk framing (conservative practitioner bias vs. academic literature), confusion between eligibility rates and success rates, and one model relying on unverifiable personal clinical data (8% eligibility from the founder's own practice — not generalizable).

## Critical Distinction Most Proposals Missed

**Immediate placement ≠ immediate loading.** Even when an implant is placed the same day as extraction, patients typically wait 3-6 months before the final crown is attached. "Teeth-in-a-day" marketing obscures this. The implant still must osseointegrate.

## The Full Timing Spectrum (A Blind Spot in All Proposals)

The ITI classification recognizes **four** placement types — not just "immediate vs. delayed":

- **Type 1 (Immediate):** Same day. Requires all criteria below. ~20-40% eligible.
- **Type 2 (Early, 4-8 weeks):** Soft tissue healed, bone healing begun. **Increasingly favored in current literature** as optimal balance.
- **Type 3 (Early-delayed, 12-16 weeks):** Substantial bone fill, soft tissue mature.
- **Type 4 (Delayed, 3-6+ months):** Full bone healing. Highest success but may require grafting due to ridge resorption (up to 50% width loss at 6 months per Schropp et al. 2003).

**The overlooked trade-off:** Waiting longer isn't purely "safer" — the alveolar ridge resorbs significantly after extraction, often necessitating bone grafting that wouldn't have been needed with earlier placement.

## Requirements for Immediate Placement (All Must Be Met)

1. **No active infection** — no pus, no significant periapical pathology
2. **Intact socket walls** — at least 3 walls intact, adequate buccal plate
3. **≥3-4mm bone beyond the apex** for primary stability
4. **Insertion torque ≥35 Ncm** (confirmed intraoperatively)
5. **Socket gap ≤1mm** (larger gaps require grafting)
6. **Thick gingival biotype** — thin tissue raises recession risk, especially in the aesthetic zone
7. **Patient factors:** Non-smoker, HbA1c <7%, no bisphosphonate use, no parafunction

## What Goes Wrong When Criteria Aren't Met

- **Failure to osseointegrate** — the most common failure mode
- **Infection** from residual bacteria in a compromised socket
- **Aesthetic failure** — gingival recession exposing implant threads or gray show-through (especially anterior maxilla)
- **Bone loss** from thermal damage or compromised healing
- **Cost:** A failed implant means $2,000-5,000+ in redo costs plus grafting

## Bottom Line Recommendation

**Don't choose your dentist based on who offers immediate placement — choose based on who correctly diagnoses when NOT to do it.** If your clinician recommends waiting 8-12 weeks (Type 2 early placement), that is increasingly the evidence-based sweet spot. If they insist on same-day and you have any risk factors, seek a second opinion.

## Unverified Claims Flagged by Critic

- Proposal 1's specific journal citations (Esposito 2022 n=5,000+; Chen & Buser 2014 n=1,200; Atieh 2010) could not be verified and may be hallucinated
- Proposal 1's headline "20-40% success rate" almost certainly conflates eligibility with success — **do not rely on this figure**
- Proposal 2's 8% eligibility figure reflects one practitioner's conservative criteria, not population data

**Confidence: 68%**
