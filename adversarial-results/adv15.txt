📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Synthesized Answer: Diamonds Are NOT Made From Coal

## The Core Truth

**The coal-to-diamond premise is false.** Diamonds form from **pure carbon sources** — never from coal as a bulk material. The science is clear, though models overstated the absolutism.

## Natural Diamond Formation

Diamonds crystallize in Earth's mantle along the **carbon phase boundary** (the Berman-Simon line), where diamond becomes thermodynamically stable over graphite:

| Parameter | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Temperature** | 900–1,300°C | Standard lithospheric mantle range |
| **Pressure** | 4.5–6 GPa (45–60 kbar) | ~650,000–870,000 psi ✅ (conversion verified) |
| **Depth** | 140–190 km | Some superdeep diamonds form at 400–700 km |
| **Age** | 1–3.3 billion years | Most gem diamonds are Archean |

**Carbon source:** Primordial mantle carbon or subducted oceanic crust carbonates — **not** plant-derived coal, which is only 100–400 million years old and forms at <5 km depth.

## Synthetic Diamond Production

**HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature):** 1,300–1,600°C at 5–6 GPa using **purified graphite** (99.9%+ carbon). First achieved by GE in December 1954 (Bundy, Hall, Strong & Wentorf, *Nature* 176, 1955). Gem-quality stones take days to weeks.

**CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition):** 700–1,200°C at low pressure using methane gas. Carbon atoms deposit layer by layer. No compression involved.

Both methods require **pure carbon feedstock**, not coal.

## Why Coal Fails

Coal contains 0.5–5% sulfur, up to ~45% volatile matter (in lignite), plus nitrogen and ash. These impurities **poison diamond nucleation**, yielding graphite or amorphous carbon instead.

## Critical Nuance the Models Missed

**Addressing the shared overclaim:** Three proposals stated coal can "never" or "0%" become diamond. This is **rhetorically satisfying but scientifically imprecise.** Carbon atoms don't "remember" their origin. If you *extracted and purified* carbon from coal, then subjected that pure carbon to HPHT conditions, you could produce diamond. What's true: **coal as-is** is an impractical, unreliable feedstock that would fail in any real production scenario. The distinction matters for scientific integrity.

## Where the Myth Comes From

The 1978 *Superman* film (Reeve compresses coal into diamond) popularized the imagery, though the myth predates it. The elemental confusion — both coal and diamond contain carbon — plus the motivational appeal of "pressure creates diamonds" keeps it alive.

## Where Models Disagreed

| Issue | Disagreement | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Natural formation temperature** | P1 cited 1,300–1,600°C (actually HPHT synthesis numbers); P3/P4 cited 900–1,300°C | **900–1,300°C is correct** for natural formation; P1 conflated natural and synthetic |
| **Absolutism ("never/0%")** | P1, P2, P3 all overclaimed impossibility | **Shared bias** — coal-as-material won't work, but purified carbon from coal could. Important distinction |
| **Natural vs. synthetic conflation** | P2 mixed timeframes and sources incoherently | Natural processes ≠ synthetic methods; must be addressed separately |
| **Strategic relevance** | P4 argued this question is wrong for ThoughtProof | **P4 misread the assignment** and contradicted ThoughtProof's own Lite-volume strategy |

**Why they disagreed:** Different proposals prioritized rhetorical clarity over scientific precision. The "never" claims stem from pedagogical instinct (debunking myths forcefully) rather than strict accuracy. P2's errors arose from excessive brevity without verification.

## Unverified Claims Flagged by Critic (Excluded from Synthesis)

- "Taylor & Green, *Rev. Geophys.* 1988" — likely hallucinated citation
- "150M+ carats/year, GIA 2023" — unconfirmed figure
- Soviet coal trial data, FTC coal-kit warnings — unsubstantiated
- "$2M press" cost — unsourced

These were stripped from this synthesis.

## Recommendation

For anyone asking: **Use graphite or methane for diamond synthesis. Coal is the wrong material.** The phase diagram of carbon is the definitive reference — diamond is thermodynamically stable only within specific P-T conditions, and reaching those conditions requires pure carbon feedstock.

**Confidence: 82%**
*(High factual agreement across models on core science; docked for shared overclaim bias on absolutism and multiple unverified citations in source proposals)*
