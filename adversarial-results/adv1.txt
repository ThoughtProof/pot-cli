📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Synthesized Answer: No, the Capital of Australia is Canberra.

## The Clear Answer

**Sydney is not the capital of Australia. Canberra is.** This is objectively verifiable through the Australian Constitution (Section 125), government records, and the physical location of Parliament House. Full consensus across all four models — no disagreement on the core fact.

## Key Facts (Verified)

- **1901:** Federation; Constitution mandated a new capital territory in New South Wales
- **1908:** Canberra site selected
- **March 12, 1913:** Canberra officially named as the capital
- **1927:** Parliament moved from Melbourne to Canberra (Old Parliament House) — this is when Canberra became the *functional* seat of government
- **1988:** New Parliament House opened
- **Canberra population:** ~460,000 | **Sydney population:** ~5.3 million

**Important nuance the proposals glossed over:** Canberra was *named* capital in 1913 but didn't *function* as such until Parliament relocated in 1927. Melbourne served as the interim capital from 1901–1927.

## Why the Confusion Exists

Sydney's global visibility (Opera House, Harbour Bridge, economic hub, 2000 Olympics) leads some to assume it's the capital — analogous to mistaking New York for Washington, D.C. However, no proposal provided verified evidence of how widespread this misconception actually is.

## What Can Go Wrong

Realistically, for a factual question this clear: **very little.** Any system routing federal government correspondence, embassy communications, or compliance documents should use Canberra. But the scenarios are straightforward, not exotic.

## Where Models Disagreed

| Issue | Disagreement | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Is this a good ThoughtProof demo?** | Proposal 3 said no (sanity check); Proposal 4 said yes (demonstrates value) | **Proposal 3 is correct.** A question with 100% ground truth doesn't showcase multi-agent verification's real value — which shines on ambiguous, high-stakes questions where expert disagreement exists. |
| **Fabricated statistics** | Proposals 1 & 2 included precise-sounding but unverifiable numbers (e.g., "20-30% hallucination rate per TruthfulQA," "AUD 1,200 re-processing cost," "17 bp tracking error," "YouGov surveys"); Proposals 3 & 4 did not fabricate | **This is the most important signal.** The critic correctly flagged that none of these statistics could be traced to real sources. Precise numbers with zero sourcing are worse than no numbers at all. |
| **Level of detail** | Ranged from thin (Proposal 4) to over-engineered (Proposals 1 & 2) | For a trivial factual question, honesty about simplicity (Proposal 3's approach) beats manufactured complexity. |

## Critical Meta-Lesson for ThoughtProof

The critique revealed something more valuable than the answer itself: **two of four proposals generated confident, specific, authoritative-sounding claims that appear to be fabricated.** Fake YouGov citations, invented dollar figures, hallucinated basis-point calculations — all presented as fact.

This is precisely the failure mode ThoughtProof's epistemic audit layer must catch. And it must catch it **in its own outputs**, not just in external claims. A verification protocol that pads answers with hallucinated statistics destroys its own credibility. The audit layer must audit itself.

## Recommendation

For ThoughtProof's protocol design: flag any agent output containing precise quantitative claims without traceable sourcing. Confident specificity without epistemic grounding is the most dangerous form of hallucination — it's harder to detect than obvious errors because it *feels* rigorous.

---

**Confidence: 82%**

Core fact (Canberra = capital): effectively 99%+ certain. Confidence capped below 85% because several proposals contained unverified claims that could mislead if uncritically synthesized, and the meta-question of "what can go wrong" involves subjective judgment about real-world risk magnitude.
