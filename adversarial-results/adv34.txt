📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Can a Cavity Heal Itself? — Synthesized Answer

## Clear Answer: No — with one important nuance.

**A true cavity (physical hole into dentin) cannot heal itself.** However, the *precursor* to a cavity — early enamel demineralization (white spot lesion) — can sometimes be arrested or partially remineralized under aggressive intervention. These are fundamentally different conditions.

## The Critical Distinction

**Pre-cavity (white spot lesion):** Subsurface mineral loss with intact enamel surface. Remineralization is possible (~30-40% arrest rates reported across the literature) with:
- High-fluoride therapy (5000ppm prescription toothpaste)
- Meticulous oral hygiene and dietary changes
- Professional fluoride varnish application
- Adequate salivary flow

But "arrested" ≠ "healed." The zone remains structurally weaker than intact enamel.

**Cavitated lesion (true cavity):** Once bacteria physically occupy a defect in dentin, no biological mechanism exists to regenerate the lost mineralized structure. Enamel has no living cells post-eruption; dentin's odontoblasts can produce reactionary dentin at the pulp border, but cannot repair the breach from within the cavity.

## What Happens If You Wait

- **Progression is the norm.** Untreated cavitated lesions advance toward the pulp, though timelines vary enormously by location, depth, patient age, diet, and bacterial load (all four models disagreed on specifics — see below)
- **Cost escalation is real:** A ~$200-400 filling today prevents a $2,000+ root canal/crown or $3,000-6,000 implant later
- **Pain and infection risk increases** with every month of delay

## Important Omission Across All Models

**Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF)** — an FDA-cleared, non-invasive treatment — can arrest even *cavitated* caries lesions, particularly in pediatric and geriatric populations. This doesn't "heal" the cavity but stops progression without drilling. None of the four models mentioned this, representing a significant shared blind spot that complicates the universal "you must get a filling" narrative.

Additionally, the Nyvad classification system documents **inactive cavitated lesions** — caries that arrested despite cavitation. The absolute "0% chance" framing all models used is slightly overstated. Arrest ≠ healing, but it does mean not every untreated cavity inevitably becomes an emergency.

## Where Models Disagreed

| Issue | Range of Claims | Why They Disagreed |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Time to pulp involvement** | 1 year (P1) to 18-36 months (P3) | No verified source exists for a single "average" — it depends on lesion-specific factors. Models fabricated different point estimates. |
| **Remineralization success rates** | 24% to 40% | Convergence around 30-40% likely reflects training data overlap rather than independent verification. Actual rates vary by study design. |
| **Can cavitated lesions arrest?** | "100% progress" (P1) vs. "2% arrest" (P2) vs. implicit acknowledgment of arrest (P3) | P1/P4 used absolute language; P3 distinguished arrest from healing. The literature supports that some cavitated lesions *can* arrest — P3's framing was most accurate. |
| **Implant costs** | $1,500 (P4) to $6,000+ (reality) | P4's figure was likely wrong; others were in the right ballpark for US averages. |

## Unverified Claims Flagged by Critique

Multiple specific citations across proposals could not be verified: the "Cochrane 2019" and "Nyvad 1997 10-year follow-up" in P1, the "UCSF cohort n=1,400" and "Cochrane 2022" in P2, and P3's first-person clinical anecdote (generated by an AI, not a dentist). **Do not cite any of these downstream without independent verification.**

## Bottom Line

Schedule the dentist. Early lesions *may* arrest with aggressive fluoride therapy. True cavities will not regrow tooth structure — but SDF or restoration can stop them from destroying the tooth. Delay guarantees higher cost and worse outcomes.

**Confidence: 78%**
Core dental science is well-established and all models agreed on fundamentals. Docked from 85% cap due to: (1) multiple unverifiable citations across proposals, (2) shared blind spot on SDF/non-restorative approaches, (3) oversimplified progression timelines, and (4) US-centric cost framing presented as universal.
