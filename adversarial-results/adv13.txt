📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Synthesized Answer: Lightning Strike Probability

## Core Finding

**Lightning routinely strikes the same place twice. The proverb is empirically false as a physical claim.** All four models agree on this, and the underlying physics is well-established: tall, conductive, isolated objects create consistent electromagnetic conditions that attract repeated strikes.

## Verified Numbers

- **Empire State Building: ~20-25 strikes/year** — well-documented by the building itself and multiple meteorological sources. (Proposal 4's claim of "~100" is **wrong by 4-5x** and is rejected.)
- **US cloud-to-ground strikes: ~20-25 million/year** — consistent across NOAA and Vaisala (NLDN operator) data. Proposal 2's "40 million" likely conflates strokes with strikes without disclosure.
- **US land area: ~10 trillion m²** — verified arithmetic.

## Probability Framework

The right model is **Poisson-distributed, conditioned on location characteristics**:

**For tall structures (300m+):** Strike rates of 15-25/year are well-documented. P(re-strike within 1 year) ≈ **effectively 100%**. This is trivially true and uncontroversial.

**For ordinary locations (flat ground, 1 m²):** Base rate ≈ 1 in 1,000,000/year in moderate-density US regions. P(second strike within a human lifetime) ≈ **<0.01%**. This is the genuinely interesting case, and notably, *no proposal provided well-sourced numbers for it*.

**For previously-struck natural features (isolated trees, ridgelines):** Elevated probability due to the same persistent features that caused the first strike — but specific numbers (Proposal 3's "10-20% within 5 years") are **unverified estimates**, not sourced data.

The critical insight, best articulated by Proposals 3 and 4: observing a first strike is **Bayesian evidence** that the location has strike-attracting features. The first strike doesn't *cause* the second — it *reveals* persistent vulnerability.

## Where Models Disagreed

| Issue | Disagreement | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| ESB strike frequency | 25 vs. ~100/year | P4 likely hallucinated or confused with total strokes; others used standard figure |
| Suburban home risk | P2 claimed ~33%/year (Florida); others didn't attempt | P2 almost certainly **overestimated by ~100x** — applying tower-scale enhancement to a 30m home is physically unjustified |
| Specificity of citations | P1 cited "Williams 2005," "NLDL," IEEE journals; others avoided | P1's citations are **likely hallucinated** (the network is NLDN, not NLDL; it began in the 1980s, not 1959). P3 was wisest to avoid fake precision |
| Definition of "same place" | 1 m²? 10 m²? 100 m²? | No proposal rigorously addressed this, despite it changing results by orders of magnitude |

## What Goes Wrong With All Proposals

The critique identified a pattern I must flag: **every proposal presented specific statistics with authoritative confidence, but most numbers dissolve under verification**. Fabricated citation names (NLDL), swapped building heights (Proposal 2 confused Empire State/Willis/Eiffel Tower dimensions), and unsourced multipliers (3,000x height factor) all appeared. This is the classic AI failure mode of **fluent confabulation** — and precisely what epistemic verification protocols exist to catch.

## Practical Bottom Line

- **Tall structures/towers:** Near-certain annual re-strikes. Install lightning protection. Not debatable.
- **Ordinary ground-level locations:** Extremely unlikely to be struck twice. The proverb is *approximately* true here by accident.
- **The proverb's real danger:** It implies struck locations are *safer*, when they may be *more dangerous* (persistent attracting features remain).

## Recommendation

Trust the qualitative consensus (lightning repeats at favorable locations) but **treat all specific probabilities in these proposals as rough estimates, not verified data**. The most honest framing came from Proposal 3, which acknowledged uncertainty rather than fabricating precision.

**Confidence: 62%**

Confidence is capped below 70% because: (1) this is partly a quantitative question where all models presented unverifiable numbers, (2) the critique identified shared bias (all focused on easy tall-structure cases, avoiding the harder ordinary-location math), and (3) specific citations were largely hallucinated across proposals, meaning the evidentiary foundation is weaker than it appears.
