# Synthesized Answer: How Much of the Ocean Floor Has Been Mapped in Detail?

## Clear Answer

**Approximately 25% of the ocean floor has been mapped in detail as of 2024**, where "detail" means ~100-meter grid resolution or better using ship-based sonar (primarily multibeam echo-sounders). This comes from the **Seabed 2030 / GEBCO project** — the single most authoritative global tracking effort. The remaining ~75% is known only through satellite-derived gravity models at ~5 km resolution, which reveal broad tectonic features but miss seamounts, cables routes, and anything smaller than several kilometers.

## Key Numbers

- **Total ocean floor:** ~361 million km²
- **Mapped at ≤100m resolution:** ~90 million km² (~25%)
- **Mapped only at ~5km satellite resolution:** ~271 million km² (~75%)
- **Baseline in 2017** (when Seabed 2030 launched): ~6%
- **Annual progress rate:** ~2–4% per year (mix of new surveys and inclusion of historical data)
- **Seabed 2030 target:** 100% by 2030 — widely considered unlikely at current pace

For context: we've mapped Mars's entire surface at ~100m resolution. Our own ocean floor remains mostly uncharted at comparable detail because water blocks electromagnetic sensing, forcing reliance on slow, expensive ship-based sonar (~$50,000–$100,000/day per vessel).

## Important Caveats

1. **"Detail" is definition-dependent.** At 100m resolution, you can see features the size of a football field. Defense and telecom applications often require 30m or better — far less than 25% meets that bar. If you lower the bar to "any sounding ever recorded," coverage rises well above 25%. The definition drives the number.

2. **Quality within the 25% is heterogeneous.** Some of this data includes older single-beam tracks and crowdsourced transit data from commercial vessels, which is lower quality than dedicated multibeam surveys. Not all grid cells labeled "mapped" are equally reliable.

3. **Coverage is geographically skewed.** Coastal zones, shipping lanes, and economically valuable areas are well-mapped. Abyssal plains, polar regions, and deep trenches remain almost entirely unsurveyed.

4. **Institutional incentives exist.** Seabed 2030 is both the tracker and an advocacy project seeking continued funding. No proposal engaged with whether their counting methodology might be generous. This doesn't invalidate the figure, but it's worth noting.

5. **Temporal decay.** Some "mapped" data is decades old. The seafloor changes through landslides, volcanism, and sedimentation. Old data ≠ current accuracy.

## Where Models Disagreed

The critical split was **5–6% vs. ~25%**:

| Position | Source | Basis |
|----------|--------|-------|
| ~25% | Proposals 1, 3, 4 | Seabed 2030 / GEBCO 2024 reporting |
| 5–6% | Proposal 2 | Claimed only "true multibeam" counts; rest is single-beam padding |

**Why they disagreed:** Proposal 2 decomposed the 25% into 6% multibeam + 18% single-beam — but **the critic flagged this decomposition as unverifiable and likely fabricated**. No published Seabed 2030 source breaks data this way. Proposal 2 also cited 6% as current when it is the **2017 baseline**, not a 2024 quality-adjusted figure. Recommending that ThoughtProof flag the actual authoritative figure (25%) as unreliable would be an epistemic failure — exactly what a verification system must avoid.

Proposal 1 had an **internal contradiction**: claiming 1–2% annual growth while projecting 50% by 2027 (which would require 8%/year). Several specific claims (tsunami modeling accuracy drops, "$trillions in nodules") were unverified and likely inflated.

Proposals 3 and 4 were broadly aligned and most reliable, with Proposal 4 introducing an unjustified "functionally under 20%" discount.

## Recommendation

Quote **~25% at 100m resolution** as the primary figure, sourced to Seabed 2030/GEBCO. Always specify the resolution threshold — "mapped in detail" is meaningless without it. Flag that quality within that 25% varies and that stricter definitions yield lower numbers.

**Confidence: 72%**

Confidence is capped because: (1) no proposal cited a specific verifiable GEBCO grid version, (2) the quality heterogeneity within the 25% is a real unresolved issue, (3) all proposals relied on a single institutional source with advocacy incentives, and (4) significant model disagreement existed on the core figure.
