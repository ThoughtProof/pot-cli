📊 SYNTHESIS:

# How Much Taller is Everest Than the Second-Tallest Mountain?

## Definitive Answer

**Mount Everest exceeds K2 by approximately 238 meters (780 feet).**

- **Everest**: 8,848.86 m (29,032 ft) — per the 2020 joint China-Nepal GNSS/gravimetry survey
- **K2**: 8,611 m (28,251 ft) — the conventionally accepted figure
- **Difference**: 237.86 m, commonly rounded to ~238 m

This is a straightforward factual question with high convergence across authoritative sources.

## Where Models Disagreed

| Issue | Disagreement | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Headline difference** | Proposal 1 claimed **861 meters** while its own math showed 237.86m. All others agreed on ~237m. | This is a catastrophic self-contradiction — the most dangerous kind of error because the formatting looked authoritative. The "861" appears to be a unit confusion artifact (neither correct in feet nor meters). |
| **Everest's precise height** | P1 & P2 used 8,848.86m; P3 rounded to 8,849m; P4 used the outdated 8,848m | The 2020 official figure is 8,848.86m. P4's use of the pre-2020 number undermines its own emphasis on "definitive, verifiable" answers. |
| **Framing** | P2 answered the question cleanly. P3 and P4 injected extensive ThoughtProof business commentary. P1 buried a correct calculation under a wrong headline. | The question asked about mountain heights, not platform strategy. Two proposals prioritized marketing over accuracy. |

The core disagreement was **not substantive** — three of four proposals computed the correct difference. The outlier (P1) was internally contradictory rather than working from different data.

## Addressing Critic's Key Flags

**UNVERIFIED claims I'm excluding from the synthesis:**
- P1's "1987 Sino-Soviet K2 spat" and specific journal citations (*Survey Review* 2021, *Journal of Geodesy* 2020) — cannot be independently confirmed
- P1's "2008-2010 Karakoram surveys" confirming K2 — likely fabricated or conflated
- P2's claim "K2 is more stable" tectonically — plausible but unsourced

**Shared blind spot across all proposals:** K2's 8,611m has never received a modern GNSS resurvey comparable to Everest's 2020 measurement. The ±2-3m uncertainty applies to K2 at least as much as to Everest, meaning the true difference could range from roughly **233-243 meters**.

## What Can Go Wrong With This Answer

1. **Measurement methodology**: Snow cap vs. rock height matters. Everest's 2020 figure includes snow. K2's canonical figure has similar ambiguity.
2. **Definitional ambiguity**: "Tallest" above sea level → Everest wins. From base to summit → Mauna Kea. From Earth's center → Chimborazo. I'm using the standard convention (above mean sea level).
3. **K2 needs a modern resurvey**: The gap could shift by several meters when K2 receives GNSS-grade measurement.
4. **Tectonic change**: Both mountains are in active collision zones. Everest rises roughly 4mm/year (estimates vary), but erosion and seismic events (e.g., 2015 Nepal earthquake) can cause sudden drops. The gap is stable on any human timescale.

## Meta-Observation

This exercise demonstrates a key insight for epistemic verification: **citation density and formatting are not proxies for accuracy.** Proposal 1 had tables, decimal precision, journal names, and specific survey dates — yet its headline answer was wrong by 624 meters, contradicted by its own arithmetic. A robust verification protocol must catch internal contradictions and validate citations, not just count agreement or assess surface credibility.

**Confidence: 95%** → capped at **85%**

This is a well-established factual question with strong source convergence. The only meaningful uncertainty is the ±2-3m measurement margin on K2 and minor rounding conventions. Three of four models converged on the correct answer.

## Where Models Disagreed
See table above. The disagreement was driven by computational/unit error (P1) and outdated data (P4), not by fundamentally different frameworks or evidence bases. This pattern — surface-level disagreement masking a clear consensus — is itself a useful diagnostic signal.
