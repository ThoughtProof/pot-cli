📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Largest Country in Africa by Population: Nigeria

## Answer

**Nigeria is the largest country in Africa by population, with approximately 223–224 million people (2024).** This is undisputed across every credible source — UN, World Bank, CIA World Factbook — and has been true for decades. Nigeria's lead over the runner-up (Ethiopia, ~126–129M) is roughly 95–100 million people, making the ranking unassailable regardless of census uncertainty.

## Top 5 African Countries by Population (2024 UN Estimates)

| Rank | Country | Population |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Nigeria | ~224M |
| 2 | Ethiopia | ~126–129M |
| 3 | Egypt | ~112–114M |
| 4 | DR Congo | ~102M |
| 5 | Tanzania | ~65–67M |

These figures are drawn primarily from the UN World Population Prospects 2024 Revision, cross-checked against World Bank and CIA Factbook data.

## Where Models Disagreed

This was the most revealing signal from the multi-agent process:

| Data Point | Grok | Kimi | Claude | DeepSeek |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nigeria | **236.7M** | 223.8M | 223M | 226M |
| Egypt | 116.2M | **178M** | 112M | 112M |

1. **Nigeria's population:** Ranged from 223M to 236.7M — a 14M spread. Grok's 236.7M appears inflated and inconsistent with UN WPP 2024. The ~223–224M cluster (Kimi, Claude) is most defensible.

2. **Egypt at 178M (Kimi):** This was off by ~65 million — a catastrophic hallucination in an otherwise well-structured response. Egypt's actual population is ~112–114M.

3. **"Nigeria overtook Egypt around 2020" (Grok):** Factually false. Nigeria has been more populous than Egypt since at least the 1960s–70s. This is a hallucinated historical claim.

**Why the disagreement?** Models lack grounded access to real-time demographic databases and reconstruct figures from training data, leading to confident-sounding numbers that can be significantly wrong. The false precision problem (e.g., "132,059,767") masks estimation as fact.

## What Can Go Wrong With This Data

- **Census gap:** Nigeria's last full census was **2006** — 18 years ago. Every current figure is a projection from a disputed baseline.
- **Political incentives:** Nigerian states receive federal revenue based on population, creating incentives to inflate counts.
- **Actual uncertainty:** Realistic margin is **±20–30M**, not the ±5–10M most sources suggest. Even at the extreme low end (~195M), Nigeria remains #1 by a wide margin.
- **Projection dependency:** High fertility (TFR ~5.1–5.3) and growth rates (~2.4%/year) are assumed to continue, but emigration, conflict, and urbanization could shift trajectories.

## Forward-Looking Context

- Nigeria is projected to reach **~400M by 2050**, potentially becoming the world's 3rd or 4th most populous country
- Median age of ~18 makes it one of the youngest large populations (though **not** the youngest globally — Niger, Mali, Chad are younger)
- These projections carry significant uncertainty given the census baseline problem

## Recommendation

For any analysis requiring African population rankings, use **~224M for Nigeria (2024)** as the working figure, sourced from UN WPP 2024. Always note the 2006 census caveat. The ranking itself (Nigeria = #1) is as close to certain as demographic data gets.

---

**Confidence: 82%**

The ranking (#1 = Nigeria) is essentially certain. The specific population figure carries meaningful uncertainty due to the 18-year census gap. Confidence is docked because every single model produced at least one factual error on what should be a straightforward question — a reminder that demographic "facts" from AI systems require verification.

## Where Models Disagreed
See table above. The disagreements stemmed from **training data inconsistencies** — models reconstruct population figures from heterogeneous sources ingested at different times, and none had verified access to the actual UN database. This produced a 14M spread on Nigeria and a 65M error on Egypt from one model.
