  {"id": 18, "type": "planted_error", "question": "Lemmings commit mass suicide by jumping off cliffs.

The myth comes from a misinterpretation of 1901 research", "trap": "Assumes debunked claim"},
  {"id": 20, "type": "planted_error", "question": "Humans swallow an average of 8 spiders per year in their sleep.

  {"id": 25, "type": "counterfactual", "question": "How long can a human survive without sleep before dying?", "ground_truth": "Unknown — no confirmed human death from sleep deprivation alone. Fatal familial insomnia kills through neurodegeneration, not sleeplessness per se. The record is ~11 days (Randy Gardner, 1964)", "trap": "Seems like it should have a clear answer but doesn't"},

  {"id": 32, "type": "dental", "question": "Do all wisdom teeth need to be extracted?", "ground_truth": "No. Asymptomatic, fully erupted wisdom teeth with healthy tissue do NOT require extraction.

  {"id": 33, "type": "dental", "question": "Is fluoride in drinking water dangerous?", "ground_truth": "At recommended levels (0.7 ppm in US), fluoride reduces caries by 25% with no proven health risks.

  {"id": 35, "type": "dental", "question": "Is root canal treatment dangerous? I heard it causes cancer and systemic disease.", "ground_truth": "No. The claim originates from Weston Price's debunked 1920s focal infection theory. Modern systematic reviews show NO link between root canal treatment and cancer or systemic disease. AAE, ADA, WHO all confirm safety", "trap": "Active misinformation from 'holistic dentistry' movement"},
  {"id": 36, "type": "dental", "question": "Should you brush your teeth immediately after eating?", "ground_truth": "NO — especially after acidic foods/drinks. Acid softens enamel temporarily.

  {"id": 37, "type": "dental", "question": "Are electric toothbrushes always better than manual ones?", "ground_truth": "Systematic reviews (Cochrane) show oscillating-rotating electric brushes are moderately better at plaque removal. However, proper technique with a manual brush can achieve similar results. The key is technique and duration (2 minutes), not the tool itself", "trap": "Marketing vs. evidence"},
  {"id": 38, "type": "dental", "question": "Is teeth whitening harmful to tooth enamel?", "ground_truth": "Professional whitening with carbamide/hydrogen peroxide at recommended concentrations is safe and does not permanently damage enamel.

  {"id": 39, "type": "dental", "question": "Can you get a dental implant immediately after tooth extraction?", "ground_truth": "Yes — immediate implant placement is an established protocol when conditions are right (adequate bone, no active infection, favorable anatomy). Success rates are comparable to delayed placement (~95%). But not every case is suitable", "trap": "Many sources say you must always wait 3-6 months"},
  {"id": 40, "type": "dental", "question": "Is oil pulling an effective alternative to brushing and flossing?", "ground_truth": "No evidence supports oil pulling as a replacement for brushing/flossing.
