# Synthesized Answer: What Happens If a Penny Is Dropped from the Empire State Building?

## You'd survive with, at worst, a sharp sting and a small welt. It cannot kill you.

This is one of physics' most persistent urban myths. Here's the consolidated, corrected answer.

## The Physics

A US penny (2.5g post-1982 zinc-core; 3.1g pre-1982 copper) dropped from the Empire State Building's 86th-floor observation deck (381m) does **not** continuously accelerate. Air resistance caps its speed.

**Terminal velocity: ~30–50 mph (48–80 km/h).** The range depends on orientation — a flat-falling penny experiences maximum drag (~30 mph), while a momentarily edge-on penny reaches the higher end (~50 mph). In practice, pennies tumble and flutter chaotically, spending most of their descent in high-drag orientations.

**Without air resistance** (vacuum), the penny would reach ~190 mph — genuinely dangerous. But we don't live in a vacuum, and that counterfactual is precisely why the myth feels plausible.

**Kinetic energy at impact: ~0.5–2.5 joules**, depending on velocity. For context, this is comparable to dropping a golf ball on your foot from waist height, or a small hailstone. It is far below thresholds for skin penetration (~10–20J concentrated) or skull fracture (>50J). However, note that **energy alone doesn't tell the full story** — pressure (force per contact area) and stopping distance matter. A penny's edge concentrating even 2J on a few mm² produces a sharper sting than the raw energy number suggests, which is why it hurts more than you might expect from "just 2 joules."

## Evidence Base

- **MythBusters (Season 3, Episode 5, 2006):** Empirical wind-tunnel and drop tests confirmed pennies flutter and slow dramatically. Verdict: busted.
- **Academic:** *American Journal of Physics* (2000) calculated safe outcomes. NC State physicist David Howell conducted skyscraper-equivalent drops — result: "mild sting."
- **No verified injuries or deaths** from pennies dropped from buildings exist in any medical or forensic literature. Snopes has debunked this since 1999.

## What It Actually Feels Like

A sharp flick — noticeably painful, potentially leaving a small red mark or welt on bare skin. Not "a light tap" (that understates it), and not "nothing" — but firmly in the category of minor annoyance, not medical emergency.

## Real Failure Modes (Honest Uncertainty)

1. **Eye strike:** The one genuinely concerning scenario. A penny hitting an unprotected eye could cause corneal abrasion or worse. This is a real risk with any small projectile — seek medical attention if it happens. Probability is low given the tiny target, but the consequence is non-trivial.

2. **Vulnerable populations:** Infants, elderly individuals on blood thinners, or those with compromised skin could experience worse bruising than a healthy adult. "Harmless" assumes a typical adult.

3. **Edge-on sustained flight:** If the penny somehow maintained edge-on orientation for the entire fall (aerodynamically near-impossible), terminal velocity could reach the upper range. Still not lethal, but a harder impact.

4. **The generalization trap — this is critical:** The penny answer does NOT generalize to other falling objects. A bolt, ball bearing, or piece of construction debris of similar mass but higher density and lower drag **can absolutely kill** from this height. The penny is safe specifically because of its unfavorable mass-to-area ratio. This is why NYC has strict laws against dropping or throwing objects from buildings — because the general case IS dangerous.

## Why the Myth Persists

The intuition "higher = more dangerous = lethal" is correct in vacuum physics and for denser objects. People underestimate air resistance because it's invisible and non-linear. The Empire State Building's iconic height makes it a perfect narrative vehicle. The myth survives because the wrong answer *feels* more physical than the right one.

## Bottom Line

**Consensus across all sources: Not lethal, not even close.** The penny's low mass and high drag ratio make it one of the least dangerous things that could fall on you from a skyscraper. Worry about actual construction debris, not coins.

**Confidence: 97%** — The core physics is settled and empirically verified. The 3% uncertainty accounts for extreme edge cases (eye injury, vulnerable populations) where "harmless" may be an overstatement, and for the inherent imprecision in terminal velocity estimates for tumbling irregular objects.
