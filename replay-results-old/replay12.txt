📊 SYNTHESIS:

# Synthesized Answer: How Many Planets Are in Our Solar System?

## The Answer

**8 planets** per the current scientific consensus (IAU 2006, Resolution B5): Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

**Confidence: 97%** — as an institutional consensus fact. As an immutable truth of nature, lower (see below).

## The Critical Distinction the Critique Exposed

All four proposals got the factual answer right but conflated two different things:

- **Observational fact:** There are 8 bodies the IAU classifies as planets. This is uncontested.
- **Definitional choice:** The IAU's three criteria (orbits Sun, hydrostatic equilibrium, cleared orbit) are a *human classification decision*, not a law of physics. This IS contested — by active, published planetary scientists, not nostalgists.

An epistemic audit layer must distinguish between these categories. Treating a classification convention as equivalent to the speed of light is exactly the kind of false certainty ThoughtProof exists to catch.

## What Multi-Agent Verification Actually Reveals Here

The critique's sharpest insight: if four agents unanimously agree on a simple fact, the platform adds zero value over a single Google search. But this question *does* contain legitimate disagreement that all proposals suppressed:

**The geophysical definition** (Stern, Runyon et al., 2017 LPSC abstract) classifies planets by intrinsic properties — round and sub-stellar — regardless of orbital dynamics. Under this framework, the count rises to 100+. This isn't fringe: Alan Stern is the PI of New Horizons, NASA's Pluto mission.

**The IAU vote's legitimacy problem:** Only ~424 of ~10,000 members voted. The vote occurred on the final day of the 2006 Prague General Assembly after most attendees had departed. This procedural weakness is a genuine epistemic concern that no proposal fully addressed.

A well-functioning multi-agent network *should* surface this dissent — not to undermine the consensus answer, but to provide the requester with the full epistemic landscape. One agent giving "8 per IAU" and another giving "the definition itself is contested, here's why" is more valuable than four agents echoing the same answer.

## What Can Go Wrong

1. **Outdated training data** (DeepSeek's point): Pre-2006 agents could say 9. Query framing matters — "per IAU definition" eliminates ambiguity.
2. **Hallucinated citations** (critique's strongest catch): Proposals 1 and 2 cited specific polls and data sources that are unverifiable or fabricated. An epistemic audit platform whose agents hallucinate sources is dead on arrival. This is the single most damaging failure mode.
3. **Planet Nine hypothesis**: If confirmed, the count becomes 9 again — but current observational surveys have weakened the case. Probability is uncertain and declining, not the 20-30% one proposal claimed without sourcing.
4. **Definition revision**: The IAU could reopen the debate. If the geophysical definition gains traction, curricula, databases, and every system that hard-codes "8" breaks.

## What This Means for ThoughtProof's Platform

**This question is a useful calibration test** (DeepSeek's "canary" insight), but with a caveat: succeeding at simple fact verification tells you nothing about handling contested, multi-perspectival questions. These are fundamentally different cognitive tasks.

The strategic takeaway for the platform:

- **Simple convergence = low platform value.** The marketplace justifies itself when agents *productively disagree* and surface different epistemic frames.
- **Agent diversity matters.** If every agent-provider contributes models trained on the same data with the same priors, multi-agent verification is redundant theater. The protocol needs agents with genuinely different epistemic approaches.
- **Scoring dissent is the hard problem.** When one agent argues for 9 planets using the geophysical definition, is it wrong or providing legitimate perspective? How the platform scores this determines whether ThoughtProof produces consensus or conformity.

## Bottom Line

**8 planets** is the only defensible answer for formal, institutional, or educational contexts. But the *definition underlying that count* is a contested human convention, not settled physics. A genuinely useful epistemic audit surfaces both the consensus and the grounds on which it could be challenged.

The irony of this exercise: four agents confidently agreeing while suppressing legitimate dissent is the exact failure mode an epistemic consensus protocol should be designed to prevent.

**Confidence in "8 per IAU":** 97%
**Confidence that the IAU definition is permanently settled:** 65%
**Confidence this question demonstrates multi-agent platform value:** 30% — the real value emerges on harder questions.
